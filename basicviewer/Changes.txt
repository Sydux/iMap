	** Some font changes.
	** Styles of drop downs simplified.
	** Query results now in bottom pane.
	** Basemap gallery in pane at bottom of map.
	** Location is no longer a tool on the button bar, rather it's a button on the map below the home button.
*Addition of Search Features tool in upper right.  If layers in the map on load, will be able to search for features by their default name (only searches this field).
*Updates to print tool to popup with more choices and not just ESRI's out of the box print tool.
*Update to Query Result grid and tool.

	**Ability to turn on both Simplified and Layer List (in this case simplified will be called Legend and Layer List will be titled just that).
*Removed trailing \ in AddLayers.js service URLs for better coordination with query tool.
*Updated draw tool with color options and more asthetic inferface.
*Updated MD iMap Basemap group to include MD-GIO specific basemaps in web Mercator projection allowing all public users access to MD GIO basemaps.  Facilitated in the AGO and hosted template by including the “basemap group name” and “owner” in the app.js parameter basemapGroup{}
*Added a configuration option to disable the Left Pane at application load.  Available in AGO configuration mode and also in hosted template (look for the disableLeftPane parameter in app.js)
*Fixed the display and position of the Zoom to County and Address Search widgets in Internet Explorer.

7/3/2014
* CSS corrections to allow for color changes to Home Button and recently added tools when themes are changed.  (Themes:  imap, gray, blue, green, purple, orange)
* Placement adjustments to Search and Zoom to County tools to allow better map viewing on smaller form factor screens.
* Adjustment in Table of Contents (_TOCNode.js) to correct anomalies between map symbology and Table of Contents symbology.  ("tempArray[j].url == rends[i].url" now using label, "tempArray[j].label == rends[i].label")
* Changed zoom extents for the ZoomToCounty tool.  Some counties were zooming within their boundaries. 
* Changed a parameter in Query to "like" instead of "=" to give more leeway for a choice in select by attribute query.
* Adjusted a configuration setting that corrects a tab choice when configuring the template via ArcGIS Online.  If you wanted to use and select the Query tab but not the Add Data tab, you would have gotten both anyway.
